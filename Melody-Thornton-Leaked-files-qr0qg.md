Melody Thornton has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment.

Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. Born in 1995, Melody Thornton grew up in a musical family and began singing at a young age. She was heavily influenced by artists such as Adele, Florence + The Machine, and Lorde, and began writing her own songs as a teenager.
